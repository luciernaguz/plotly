Ploty Challenge  Data Analytics Bootcamp
URL:  https://luciernaguz.github.io/plotly-challenge/.

## I liked using Plotly because of how easy the graph is generated using little code and how good it looks on a site (dashboard) there is a lot that Ploty adds.
## Like previous challenges, inquiring about information and manipulating it through d3 functions, it takes time to complete the challenge.
## For me the challenge looks complete and interesting the information (dataset) an also GiHub helps to show better the result just doing a simple setting.
