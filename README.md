# Plotly  Data Analytics
## Github Page:  https://luciernaguz.github.io/plotly-challenge/.

## I liked using Plotly because of how easy the chart is generated using little code and how good it looks on a site (dashboard) there is a lot that Plotly adds.
## Like previous challenges, inquiring about information and manipulating it through d3 functions, it takes time to complete the challenge.
## Also use the same values to generate two charts, thats great !
## For me the challenge looks complete and interesting the information (dataset), I assumed there were bacteria in the belly button but I had no idea how many and which.
## For last thatÂ´s really helpul just a little setting in Github to present the Challenge in a Github Page.
